This test_project directory is here to allow testing the command line script as a standalone.

To test it out, run:

    composer update
    
The run:

    ./bin/sphec
    
It should successfully run the suite of tests in the spec subdirectory.

There are two files there, one in the brute force PHP format, and one in the shorthand sphec notation.  This test proves that both will be loaded automatically, what type of file it is is detected by the suffix, and sphec does the right thing accordingly.
